## What should you have read?

# ==**GDW - 2 & 3**==
<!-- slide bg= "[[GDW.png]]" data-background-opacity="0.7" -->
notes: these chapters are basically the vocabulary of design. As you get further away from being a gamer, these words will start to make their way into your lexicon until they are commonplace.

# ==Half-Real 2==
notes: This second chapter is called, "Video Games and the Classic Game Model" and hoo boy is it fun. There's an important phrase I want you to see, read, and think about.

# Games are older than culture
notes: every species on earth plays and that is important to remember. How do other creatures play? Why do they play? What function does play serve to a species trying to disconnect itself from all other species on earth? And through this thought exercise, we see a starting place for games being, "Half Real"

# Quiz time!

# What did you like?
notes: This game has been used for this kind of exercise for a while now. It's useful because it gets at a person's capacity to do the thing they're meant to do but ALSO allow recruiters to see how you play with the unknown, within the limits provided, and in doing so, we understand how you would be on a team.

# What did you hate?
notes: Not all design is for everyone. This game was meant for kids and we have a problem with play in society because we tend to define play as a childish exercise despite it being used in very serious ways. And so hating this, why you hated it in this setting is useful because you can learn. Hating it in an interview will result in not getting a job.

# Why?
notes: So, gamers have opinions about things. NERF! COMMON SENSE! QUALITY OF LIFE!?! but you are different. You want to know why you dislike something, why others dislike something, so you can learn from it. What did you learn?

# Monad
# Dyad

# Triad
notes: You will be making another game, a game expansion, for an existing IP. You will be doing this in a dyad, a team of 2. I want you each over the week to think about this phrase: 
--
# 2 people is a conversation
--
# 3 people is a society
