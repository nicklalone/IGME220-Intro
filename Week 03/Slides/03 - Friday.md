# Players
notes: is this always the case? Is there such a thing as a 0-player game? The suits comment about "Lusory Attitude" is interesting wherein players enter a "curious state of affairs wherein one adopts rules which require one to employ worse rather than better means for reaching an end." = limits once again
--
# Objectives / Goals
note: We have to be aiming at some outcome. This is where you have the most variability in games versus something like a film. "to win" might be a goal or objective but "how" will you do this is the game. 
--
# Procedures
note: the actions or methods of play allowed by the rules. These guide player behavior and are, in fact, that thing that defines a game. 
--
# Rules
note: these define game objects, prescibe principles, and limit behaviors. How are they different from procedures? Here, we can say that a procedure for poker might be to form a hand to compete against other hands but the rules define which hands you can make, how many cards, what cards, etc.
--
# Resources
note: Items made valuable by their scarcity and utility. These can be used to further our aims; they can be combined to make new products or items, and they can be bought and sold in various types of markets. This could be a discard pile, a collectible element of games, money to buy better equipment, etc.

# Conflict
note: This, for most species, is the crux of play. What does it mean?
--
# Boundaries
note: Magic Circle.
--
# Outcomes
note: When play ends.
