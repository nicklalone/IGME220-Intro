# Playtest Week

notes:

# 3 Reasons we do board games in class
--
## 1. We need to explore how rules impact us, not how they are programmed.
notes: this allows us to consider the rules without considering their expression in code. Code is execution and so we need to balance the formation of rules with their execution. 
--
## 2. Humans have to maintain the game state.

Notes: this is in service to 1 and is important as because a game designer is an advocate for the user, the player, the consumer, we have to understand HOW we're advocating for them. And here, outside of execution, you can look at cause and effect. You're literally looking at FAFO in real time.
--
## 3. It allows you to play around with design to find your happy space in design.

# Playtesting is about iterating
# Advocacy never stops

notes: for the first 2 assignments, we do not really get past the ideation stage. As we get into bigger assignments, we will get close to and partially through pre-production.

## for now, play through specific scenarios, specific potential sticky points.
--
## have your players talk through their thought processes while you take notes.
