# Playtest Week
notes: You need to be digging into what you are making. It isn't enough to just draw on a canvas. You need to know if the users who would look at your canvas are interested.

# 3 Reasons we do board games in class
--
## 1. We need to explore how rules impact us, not how they are programmed.
notes: this allows us to consider the rules without considering their expression in code. Code is execution and so we need to balance the formation of rules with their execution. 
--
## 2. Humans have to maintain the game state.

Notes: this is in service to 1 and is important as because a game designer is an advocate for the user, the player, the consumer, we have to understand HOW we're advocating for them. And here, outside of execution, you can look at cause and effect. You're literally looking at FAFO in real time.
--
## 3. It allows you to play around with design to find your happy space in design. 
notes: Remember that this is a muscle you have to develop. It is your fitness that will separate you from others. It is your fitness that will afford you a unique status of being interesting to people looking at hundreds, if not thousands of applications for every position in a game company.

# Playtesting is about iterating
# Advocacy never stops
notes: Playtesting, much like design, is an art form that can go south quickly. Your job here is to find things your users aren't doing well or don't like, and deciding what to do with them.

notes: for the first 2 assignments, we do not really get past the ideation stage. As we get into bigger assignments, we will get close to and partially through pre-production.

# Types of playtests

## Self-Testing
notes: this is you playing at home to make sure that there aren't outcomes you didn't plan for. This is important when editing your initial product that you'll be bringing to the floor.

## Playtesting with Confidants (friends)
notes: I tend to use Celeste as an example here. For 4 days, the two designers of Celeste sat in a room with friends and wrote Celeste in Lua in order to get an actionable prototype they could then bring to the pico-8 community. As they wrote portions of the game, their friends did this. Additionally, I like to use Nathan Hayden as an example. They all play standing up and as they play a game they're testing with friends, they hand out Bowie knives and will draw them when there is a disagreement to see who is correct. You and your friends can get yourselves into all manner of debate and discussion around this. Be sure to lay ground rules.

# More later

## for now, play through specific scenarios, specific potential sticky points.
--
## have your players talk through their thought processes while you take notes.

## Have each member of the team do this.
