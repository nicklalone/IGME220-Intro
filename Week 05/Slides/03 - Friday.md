# The Rules of Playtesting!
--
## Playtest before you think you are ready

notes: You always playtest a work in progress, not a finished design. That means you should playtest as early as you possibly can—usually much earlier than you think you should. It is much much better to playtest your ugly prototype than to wait and playtest a more polished project. A playtest is not a presentation. If you feel ready and comfortable to present and playtest your design, you have waited too long—it is probably too late to make substantial changes. Train yourself to overcome your discomfort and playtest as early in the process as you possibly can. Is it too early for you to playtest? If the answer is yes, then playtest anyway.

## Strategize for Early Playtesting
notes: Simplify your project so that you can playtest today. Target it as well so you can streamline the questions and content you have questions about. This gets into...
--
## Know Why You Are Playtesting
Notes: What is the one key question that you want your playtest to answer? For you all doing FRAG expansions, what is the core of your experience? Can you test it quickly?
--
## Prepare Variations
notes: What can you change to try out different variations of your project? Be prepared with a few different approaches. While we may not get to everything, try it out a few different ways and see which is the most useful (not successful, but useful.)
--
## Be grateful
notes: Take a deep breath and say thanks. People checking your game out, they never have to. But having folks check on it is fantastic! Thank them! 
--
## Design the learning experience
notes: Remember to design the way that people will learn about your project. If you are creating a complicated interactive system, the experience of learning how to understand and interact with the system is an important part of the overall design problem.Does your playtest address the learning process? This is the paradox of the active user.

## Paradox of the Active User
## or
## Users will never "learn" your game
notes: The "paradox of the active user" is a paradox because users would save time in the long term by taking some initial time to optimize the system and learn more about it. But that's not how people behave in the real world, so we cannot allow engineers to build products for an idealized rational user when real humans are irrational: we must design for the way users actually behave.
--
## blame yourself
notes: Never make your playtesters feel foolish.
--
## Know your testers
notes: What do you need to know about your playtesters before the playtest begins? If you are meeting them for the first time or don’t know them very well, talk with each person and take notes that will help put their reaction to your project in context. Playtesters come in many varieties. For example, the learning curve of a hardcore gamer is very different than someone without deep experience in a particular game genre. Do you know who your playtesters are?
--
## Don't explain
notes: Is it possible not to say anything before the playtest starts?
--
## Take Notes
notes: Prepare a notes sheet and use it. It is worth the extra effort.

# During a playtest
--
## Be selfish
notes: Don't worry about being entertaining
--
## Encourage your playtesters to talk aloud
notes: Don't be afraid to remind them to speak aloud their thoughts about the game. 
--
## Notice Everything

--
## Shut up
### Your mouth does not exist.

--
## Big Picture
notes: remember impact is just as important as function.
--
## Data = Good
notes: What data will ask the right questions?
--
## answer questions with questions
notes: Each time a playtester asks you something, dig, ask them a question back
--
## Hunger for failure
notes: You aren't doing this to feel good about yourself, you are advocating for your users.
