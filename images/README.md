# IGME220-Intro
Repository for Notes, Exercises, and Resources for IGME 220. 

**Structure of Class**
Generally, this is a course meant to immerse you in the act of design by being designed with
games in mind. We will focus on reading, writing, designing, and editing. Here, we will talk
about the various assignments that will start your journey from being a consumer of games to
being a creator of games. First, we will have 4 design sprints followed by 4 Editing Sprints
followed by a final project. Each sprint will add n+1 team members or 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
for final project.

**Textbook**
1. Tracy Fullerton - **Game Design Workshop** - 5th Edition
2. Jesper Juul - **Half Real**

The point spread for this course is as follows:

| Item                | Frequency | Points Per | Total Points | Running Total |
| ------------------- | :-------: | :--------: | :----------: | :-----------: |
| **Design Sprint**   |     4     |     50     |     200      |      200      |
| **Editing Sprint**  |     4     |     50     |     200      |      400      |
| **Design Notebook** |    10     |     15     |     150      |      550      |
| **Game Critique**   |     5     |     30     |     150      |      700      |
| **Final Project**   |     1     |    300     |     300      |     1000      |
### Design Sprint
You can't become a designer without designing. As Ira Glass tells us, we will be disappointed in our designs for a while despite having what we might consider good taste. But we have to stick with it and I can kind of force you to stick with it by requiring assignments from you. Besides, having a successful design is less about your capacity as a designer and more about your capacity as an observer of humanity. Each sprint will be based on a prompt and as stated above, each sprint will add n+1 team members or $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5$ for final project.
### Editing Sprint
Teamwork is something that many gamers lack because of how gaming has developed since 2001. No longer are we in-person with each other, but connected across distances to other people in similar situations. These weeks will vary. Sometimes you'll be given someone else's product to edit whereas others you'll be given another week to develop an idea. Once done, you'll have an object to develop further for your final project or outside of class if you like the idea.
### Design Notebook
The basis of this assignment is relatively simple. We need to write down ideas, concepts, and thoughts related to design all the time. We might see something in the world that inspires us, we might see games that inspire us, we might see a tweet, skeet, or post that keeps us thinking.

That's the purpose of these assignments. We need better organization and so i'm forcing it on you. 

The normal parameters of this assignment are: 
- Around 300 words based on a selected prompt.
- 5 game design ideas at around a sentence each.
- Reaction to 1 new game outside your comfort zone
	- For your first game, play [Decathlon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6955/reiner-knizias-decathlon) in the syllabus. 

For week 1, there are 3 prompts worth exploring in chapter 1: 
1. Page 8 - Exercise 1.2
2. Page 10 - Exercise 1.3
3. Page 11 - Exercise 1.5

These assignments should be fun to do. If you're finding them difficult or stupid, that's on you as you're missing a chance to think about and do design work. Game design is not simply slamming your face into a keyboard and hoping some roguelike comes out of it.
### Game Critique
Over the course of the semester, you must explore a variety of games that you probably haven't played before. You will have a choice of 10 games with a mixture being available as Print and Play, Tabletop Simulator, VASL, or some other means. By the end of the semester, I want to see a criticism of 5 of them. The list is as follows: 
* [Dungeon Deck](https://github.com/dragonsploder/DungeonDeck)
* [Just One Boss](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=49234)
* [The Dice Must Flow](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173486/dune-the-dice-game)
* [Sprawopolis](https://buttonshygames.com/products/sprawlopolis-print-play}{Sprawopolis)
* [Realm of the Mad God](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200210/Realm_of_the_Mad_God_Exalt/)
* [Airborne in my Pocket](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42651/airborne-in-my-pocket)
* [Basement Bathysphere](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/255360/bargain-basement-bathysphere)
* [Ghosts Love Candy Too](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/349242/ghosts-love-candy-too)
* [Quests Over Coffee](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/367030/quests-over-coffee)
* [Rogue (yes, that Rogue)](https://playclassic.games/games/role-playing-dos-games-online/play-rogue-online/play/)

Assignment should include the following headers and will be somewhere around 500 words: 
* **Core Loop** - 20 - 50 words
* **Sense of Tension** - 100 words 
* **What other games it reminds you of and why** - 200 words
* **How you'd improve the game** - 200 words
### Final Project
This is a sprint that will have teams of around 5 members. You will have 5 weeks, give or take, and we will meet on Wednesdays for playtesting. By the end of exam week, you will need: 

* A Pitch Document graded by 3 peers
* Instruction Manual
* Print and Play Files
* Post Mortem - 250 words
* Plan to digitize - 250 words
* Ideas for further development
