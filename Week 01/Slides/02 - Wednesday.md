## What is all this?
note: The point of this course is to get you started making games. I'm talking about coding, coding is not design. Instead, I'm talking about plotting out how your game works. We can sometimes call this pre-production though what we're doing here is probably pre-pre-production.

# Intro to Game Design
note: This course is INTRO to game design. Many of you have been playing games religiously since you were able to. It is very different making the thing you consume. This course is meant to create better routines and everyday activities that will make your transition easier.

# How Class Work?
notes: open up Overleaf > Github > mention books > MyCourses.

# Board Games
note: some folks will use the term analog games. I hate this term so i will never use it. That should not stop you. Call them what you want.

note: So many of you will be interested in this but I want you to know that this is a very difficult task, especially when starting out. You will feel discouraged, angry, and depressed about your design chops this semester. That's ok! If it wasn't hard, it wouldn't be worth doing.

# First step:

# Game Designer 
note: The role of the game design is, first and foremost, to be an advocate for the player. Your job as the designer is to keep a laser like focus on your design. This means not getting distracted or bogged down by supplemental systems or narrative ideas.

#  Core Gameplay (Core Loop)
Note: "procedures that a player repeats most often while striving to achieve the game's overall goal."

# Mechanics

## Prototyping
Note: this is where we build enough of a game to test its core capabilities. There are multiple layers to this but we're focusing on one.
--
## Playtesting
Note: This is where your game meets your users. How you use this information is far more important, especially to new designers, than your own voice.
