## What is all this?
note: The point of this course is to get you started making games. I'm talking about coding, coding is not design. Instead, I'm talking about plotting out how your game works. We can sometimes call this pre-production though what we're doing here is probably pre-pre-production.
--
# Intro to Game Design
note: This course is INTRO to game design. Many of you have been playing games religiously since you were able to. It is very different making the thing you consume. This course is meant to create better routines and everyday activities that will make your transition easier.

# REMINDER: 3 things
--
# 1. No coding 
note: programming is not game design. Game design and everything you'll be making, you should know what you're going to make before code begins. It might change when coding starts because of engine issues, knowledge gaps, time, money, all sorts of things, but the intent is there. 
--
# 2. Portfolios
note: This course should have games that go into your portfolio. You should have a portfolio already and are constantly adding to it. We can learn more about how well you understand design in small, print and play boardgames than a poor replication of an existing game. Alternatively, if you can make games that are interesting and neat, that works too. Everything you do in every class for this program should somehow end up in your portfolio. If you do bad work, fix it. Working on things doesn't stop when the semester does.

# 3. 'a lil bit'
note: Programmers need to understand design as well as society (a lil bit). Designers need to understand programming, art, art direction, UX, and more (a lil bit). Artists need to know a lil bit about engines, programming, and more. Each of you will probably already have a specialty in mind, but also know that learning a lil bit of other stuff helps with the thing you know a lotta bit about.

# Board Games
note: some folks will use the term analog games. I hate this term so i will never use it. That should not stop you. Call them what you want.

![[thinkingdoing.png]]
note: So many of you will be interested in this but I want you to know that this is a very difficult task, especially when starting out. You will feel discouraged, angry, and depressed about your design chops this semester. That's ok! If it wasn't hard, it wouldn't be worth doing.

# Game Designer 
note: The role of the game design is, first and foremost, to be an advocate for the player. Your job as the designer is to keep a laser like focus on your design. This means not getting distracted or bogged down by supplemental systems or narrative ideas.

Note: "procedures that a player repeats most often while striving to achieve the game's overall goal."
