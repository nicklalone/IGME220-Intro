# Developer's Diary
--
# Reading
--
# Your game is due tomorrow

# Everything else, Sunday

## Spend hour or two on diary
--
## incorporate it 
## into your life
note: The reason the diary is important is that game ideas come from play and most of our life is devoted to this concept, we are always learning. It's like a dream diary. If we don't write it down, we'll forget it.
