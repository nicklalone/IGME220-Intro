note: This is called Game Design and Development 1. In this course, we will be discussing game design and its relationship to the reality we live in. There will be no coding in this course as we are focused on what might be called Pre-Production or even the steps taken before pre-production. We will discuss how the content of this course allows you to examine things in the real world from a playful lens so that you can use those observations in the games you will eventually make. We will be establishing normal processes for design including the origin and development of ideas that you will eventually digitize (or not depending on the games you want to make). Everything we do in this course should be fodder for your portfolios which we will discuss informally.

# 3 things to know about this course
--
# 1. No coding 
note: Consider the phrase, 'lil bit'. Everyone needs to know a lil bit about everyone else's job and the thing that blends everyone together is "design." We all have a lil bit of a difference.

notes: note that this figure shows 4 phases of game making: ideation, preproduction, full production, and post production. Programming shouldn't begin in earnest until sometime in preproduction though you may experiment with control schema, rapid prototypes, and seeing if you understand the game you want to make.

# 2. Portfolios but no portfolios
note: here, remember to say that while we aren't going to explicitly dive into portfolios, this is a thing you should always be thinking about. We'll be doing things that create, "print and play" files. Your job will be in that space.

# 3. Ideas into Design
note: throughout this major, we will concentrate on production as we are a production-based major. This course and the front part of 320 are focused on design.

## Let's Design!
note: I need to see where you all are at. I have a game up here that you will be playing and adding something to, 3 things, actually. Let's talk about it.

#### <u>Assignment: </u>
## Add 3 New "things" to the game.
---
# what are "things"?
--
# Mechanics?
note: new procedure in play.
--
# New Goals?
note: what might we do to change what winning means?
--
# Equipment?
note: maybe we can add stuff to our boats? 
--
# Maybe...a new theme?
note: this is just 1 thing.

## Limits and design
notes: Humans tend to define freedom on the limits that surround them. As such, designing a game
