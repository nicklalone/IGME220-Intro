note: We will be designing in basic forms this semester as I try and get you to see the world the way designers see it, not gamers.

# Overarching Design Goals for 220:

# You are no longer a gamer

# You are now a game designer 
## <font color="#ffff00">learn designer names</font>
note: No one works alone. We find things we like and go from there.

## find your voice!
note: The reason this course is set up the way it is is to help get you started on some habits that will force you to design. Stick with this regiment and you'll get better, hopefully, with time.

# Admin
note: let's talk about the syllabus

# Assignments
note: The reasons for assignments are to build repetitive muscle memory where you are constantly looking and seeking design elements in not only your normal life, but in the games you consume.
--
# Game Sprints
note: There are 4 of these spread across multiple weeks. These sprints are knowable so you could start working on them now but much like I have to separate you from your gamer status, I also must separate you from being a student, maybe failing in the process. The 4 of these sprints are simple: add to a game, make an expansion, design with constraints, design using a word, you're on your own. 
--
# Editing Sprints
note: Editing sprints will vary. You may submit things one week and then get back a game someone else made the next. These sprints are about editing and refining, not necessarily designing still. A highlight of these assignments are to get you to see that a design needs to be editing and developed. No idea is good out of the box.
--
# Final Project
note: We begin doing projects by ourselves and eventually end up with 5 on a team, making 1 game for 5 weeks. In 5 weeks, I hope you can get to a point where you're thinking about ways to digitize the experience in 320.
--
# Design Notebook
note: So, the act of design is probably something new for you. Making something that others will play means you've made some decisions about how people work, how they might be constrained, and how they might feel, act, or otherwise behave. It's important per project for you to really get into the act of writing things down, physically or otherwise. So each project, each week, you're going to write something, anything. (note here also, gen AI)

# Game Deep Dives
note: Because you are consumer-based, you will have a hard boundary around what you play. This is antithetical to design as stark bounds are, by definition, limiting factors in your potential.

# Honey Heist
note: this game started the 1-page RPG craze on itch but it has always existed in some way, shape or form. You'll be making one of these in the future. But I want you to think about this play environment, the magic circle or space of play. What makes this different from D&D or some other ttrpg? Is it actually different or just physically different?

# Catan
note: This game started the current board game renaissance. Its production values are off the chart compared to what existed previously. 
--

# Czarn√©
note: These games are made by an artist in a museum. How do these differ from Honey Heist or Catan? Is there a reason? How does the fact that these will have a limited number of copies in the wild impact it being a game? Does that matter?

# What kind of games do you want to make?
note: Each of these games exist independently as a way to think about the impact of design. Ease of play in constrained design spaces, robust play and production value, or unique, limited copies of a game meant to convey specific ideas about what games are? What are you wanting to make? Why?
