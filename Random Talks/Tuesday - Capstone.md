# Research
![[why.gif]]
Notes: Hi everyone, i'm Nick LaLone and i'm (along with Erika Mesh) torturing each and every one of you by bringing some standardization to the research process. This little bit here is focused on giving you some context and space to start working on it.

# Research
![[what.gif]]
notes: Research is important to the start of a design. It helps you reduce risks, ensure you're properly advocating for your audience, for your target genre, and type of game. Doing this stuff on the fly potentially means a ton of wasted time, and potentially uncovering the most awful bugbear to production, "uncertainty."

# So what the !#(@$ is it??

## let's talk about batman

![[Pasted image 20250831110101.png]]
notes: So, my friend Randy is Creative Director of DC Interactive. His job is to enhance the brand of DC, especially now that James Gunn has taken over. He just released this game that he as directly involved with and was responsible for the VR batman game as well. We've been debating on a Superman Game all weekend and talking about research.

## How do I start making a batman game?
Notes: questions like, "what batman would sell the best atm?" "Is batman actually a detective?" "What villains would fit in well with batman?" "what do our audiences want?" "What tone would work well?" "What were the complaints about the other lego batman games?" "What plans does Gunn have for Batman?" "How does any of that translate to a game?" "How did other Batman games work?"

## How do I start making a lego game?
Notes: LEGO games have set mechanics and expectations and need to adhere to their system. And yet, within that, we can do a ton of imaginative stuff. Where do we begin? And so you start talking to people, talking to consumers who might buy your game. This might start as 5-10 friends, then a focus group of folks you recruited from a coffee shop or class. You just keep talking to folks.

# Celeste
https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145
note: Celeste is probably a bit closer to where y'all are. This was the tech demo for Celeste that was created in 4 days around the idea of mountaineering. They designed it based on past game experience and would change things on the fly around their core based on friend feedback. This demo would secure them funding.

![[celeste quote.png]]
notes: The thing here is that both developers had spent considerable time together and had a ton of failures in their past and so they were able to focus on a concept within the limitations of PICO-8. They also loved bouldering. They understood themselves well enough to know how to focus on things. But most of all, they surrounded themselves with critical friends who would react and demand different things and given how PICO-8 worked, could fix it on the fly. Their teamwork and friendship benefited them both. You all don't have that (which is why Will is researching production processes and why team-based research is everywhere.)

# who cares?
--
# Research is about: 
--
# Curiosity
Notes: I want to make a game about something i've been learning about. Now I need to verify that everything I want to do is accurate. While games are never historically accurate, they do require enough suspension of disbelief for users to engage with. 
--
# Testing out ideas
notes: Bring people together and have them talk about your topic from a few different prompts. What are folks interested in? Don't ever forget that design is about the audience, not your perspective. So you should advocate for your user over your perspective as much as you can. This is where research helps. 
--
# Exploring computational techniques
notes: While I have been talking about high level, narrative-ish content, you can also explore computational techniques. Take Celeste again: https://noelberry.ca/posts/thedungeons/
--
# rogue + 
# like, lite, -ish
# procgen
Notes: I've seen these terms so often and it is associated with extremely technical design. You need to brush up on the history of the techniques, how it works, suggestions on where it could go. Develop your technique, test it, report out.
--
# Background and Testing of Design Concepts
--
# We do this stuff BEFORE design begins
notes: again, this is about lowering uncertainty, increasing team cohesion, and focusing your design so when you sprint, you sprint, you don't stutter walk or crawl.
--
# so we can execute design
notes: So many capstone games i've seen will start writing code before researching anything and have to scrap their whole codebase and start over. That's months of wasted time you could've saved if you did a few days of work.
--
# We do it before design or when polish begins 
Notes: I hear the word polish a lot but polish is a post-development or late development thing. 
--
# (but y'all won't get to polishing stages because of how capstone is designed)
notes: Polish isn't going to be a thing for y'all. It might be a little for a slice, but it's important not to get ahead of yourself because polishing presumes complete.

# Requirements
notes: so what do you need?
--
# LaTeX
notes: overleaf premium is included for you as a student here. USE IT.  It's so good! 
--
# 5-7 pages Abstract
notes: This does not include your references. With references, it'll prolly be closer to 7-10 pages.
--
# Sources
Notes: peer-reviewed, trustworthy sources. Your advisor can help and we'll see about getting your librarian in here.
--
# Poster Session
Notes: What is it?
--
![[Pasted image 20250831114204.png]]
--
# conversations  during showcase will change everything  
## (and that's ok)
--
# This should be an interesting project. 
notes: for you, for your team. This isn't torture, it's you digging to make your game better. This should be routine and if it isn't, it's partly that we've failed you and are trying to make it up to you now.
--
# If you aren't fascinated, ask yourself why.
notes: Life is complicated and making a game relies on life, at least a little. If you aren't a student of life, if you aren't interested in humans, game design is going to be hard.
--
# is a different topic is better?
--
# Is a different direction is better?
note:s sometimes we just need a different topic, a different idea, a different approach. 
--
# Additional food for thought
--
# it takes experience & maturity to prioritize & scope work appropriately. 
--
# The research helps demonstrate you have built those skills
---
# during the mixer Thursday, look for 3 things: 
--
# 1. Is the potential advisor excited?
notes: This means that they are fascinated by your topic, they start suggesting games, papers, ideas on how to proceed. 
--
# 2. Is the potential advisor well-versed in your potential topic?
notes: This might require you to do a little work to figure out what the potential advisor makes, researches, or otherwise has done. Sometimes, this will be very different from the actual question on this which is, "Do they get the methods i'll have to use?"
--
# 3. Look for someone you get along with but you're a little afraid of.
notes: the fear helps you focus and finish and that's what is needed. 
--
# Done is better than perfect.
---
# Also: it is easier to finish something and then use feedback to perfect it 
--
# than try for perfect the first time 
--
# A very smart person among you said that
