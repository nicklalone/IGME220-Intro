# Research
![[why.gif]]
Notes: Hi everyone, i'm Nick LaLone and i'm (along with Erika Mesch) torturing each and every one of you by bringing some standardization to the research process. This little bit here is focused on giving you some context and space to start working on it.

![[what.gif]]
notes: Research is important to the start of a design. It helps you reduce risks, ensure you're properly advocating for your audience, for your target genre, and type of game. Doing this stuff on the fly potentially means a ton of wasted time, and potentially uncovering the most awful bugbear to production, "uncertainty."

notes: So, my friend Randy is Creative Director of DC Interactive. His job is to enhance the brand of DC, especially now that James Gunn has taken over. He just released this game that he as directly involved with and was responsible for the VR batman game as well. We've been debating on a Superman Game all weekend.

## Do I start making a batman game without doing research?
Notes: questions like, "what batman would sell the best atm?" "Is batman actually a detective?" "What villains would fit in well with batman?" "what do our audiences want?" "What tone would work well?" "What were the complaints about the other lego batman games?" "What plans does Gunn have for Batman?"

notes: The thing here is that both developers had spent considerable time together and had a ton of failures in their past and so they were able to focus on a concept within the limitations of PICO-8. They understood themselves well enough to know how to focus on things. But most of all, they surrounded themselves with critical friends who would react and demand different things and given how PICO-8 worked, could fix it on the fly. Their teamwork and friendship benefited them both. You all don't have that (which is why Will is researching production processes and why team-based research is everywhere.)

# So.
--
# Research is about: 
--
# Curiosity
--
# Testing out ideas
--
# Exploring computational techniques
--
# rogue + 
# like, lite, -ish
# procgen
--
# We do this stuff BEFORE design begins
--
# so we can concentrate on realizing a design
--
# We do it before design or when polish begins 
--
# (but y'all won't get to polishing stages because of how capstone is designed)

# Requirements
--
# LaTeX
--
# 5-7 pages Abstract

# Sources

# Poster Session

## Your conversations with people during the showcase will change literally everything you just researched (and that's ok)
--
## This should be an interesting project. 
--
## If you aren't fascinated, ask yourself why.
--
## ask yourself if a different topic is best.
--
## during pitches tomorrow, look for 3 things: 
--
# 1. Is the potential advisor excited?
--
# 2. Is the potential advisor doing research in your area?
--
# 3. Look for someone you get along with but you're a little afraid of.
notes: the fear helps you focus and finish and that's what is needed.

# Done is better than perfect.

# Questions?
