\noindent \textbf{Design Notebook}

\noindent So, the act of design is probably something new for you. 
Making something that others will play means you've made some decisions about how people work, how they might be constrained, and how they might feel, act, or otherwise behave. 
It's important per project for you to really get into the act of writing things down. 
So each project, each week, you're going to write something, anything. 
Each week, what I want to see is relatively straight forward: 

\begin{tight_itemize}
    \item What are you doing?
    \item What was your first thought on how to design?
    \item What did you run into in terms of trouble?
    \item How you might digitize what you're writing in paper form?
    \item Will you continue this design later?
\end{tight_itemize}

You don't have to write these things down in a question format. Instead, just give me some narrative. It doesn't have to look perfect but it also \textbf{shouldn't look like it came from a generative AI.} If you do go down this rabbit hole, just know that you'll fail this part of class and your maximum score will begin at 85\%.

You may say to yourself, ``that's not fair!'' and you're correct, you shouldn't waste your own time like that.
