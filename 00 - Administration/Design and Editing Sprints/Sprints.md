Week 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Design Sprint #1
The Up the River Exercise.

Welcome to Game Design and Development 1. For those of you who are programmers, we won't be doing that here. For those of you who are artists, you might be able to fit something in here but it'll be quick. We're here to concentrate on pre-production or when the design of a game happens. While we will be primarily designing games for physical prototypes, you will be asked to create plans for digitizing your projects. 

This first project is JUST YOU. 

The assignment is this: 

1. Learn how to play the game as is. 
2. Make 3 substantial changes with just 1 being art-based. 
3. Write it up and turn in the following items: 
	* Instruction Manual with your additions.
	- Print and Play Files if you add any pieces.
	- Post Mortem - enough words to answer the following: 
		- What went right?
		- What went wrong?
		- If you could start over, what would you change?
		- What would be the most difficult part of this to digitize?
	- Ideas for further development

Zip these up in a .zip file and submit by Saturday night!

Week 2 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Editing Spring #1
Edit someone else’s Up the River.

Being on a production team, you never really know what you'll get when the team you're on is tasked with a new part of the project. This assignment is meant to simulate that.

This project is JUST YOU. 

In this project, you will be editing someone else's Up the River assignment. Like the previous assignment, you will be adding stuff to the game. The assignment has the following parameters: 

1. Learn how to play the game as you received it. 
2. Make 3 substantial changes with just 1 being art-based. 
3. Write it up and turn in the following items: 
	* Instruction Manual with your additions.
	- Print and Play Files if you add any pieces.
	- Post Mortem - 250 words
	- How you might digitize this - 250 words

Week 4 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Design Sprint #2
The Frag Experiment

In this assignment, you will BE ASSEMBLING IN GROUPS OF 2 and making an expansion pack for the Steve Jackson game, FRAG. This is an FPS made into a boardgame and it gets into a specific problem we tend to see in IGM, "why am I designing video games with paper?!!?!?"

Many of you want to be writing code and calling it design. Code is execution, not design. This assignment is for you. First-person shooters have a core loop that mostly focuses on shooting and that's typically mediated by the physics engine. The actual design of an FPS depends on special features, movement, and other aspects of the game. So this assignment is born as I want you to see the relationship between the logic of a boardgame versus that of Shooters themselves.

See the following: 
![[FPS Paper.png|350]]![[FPS Digital.png|310]]

You will be making an expansion for the game. It requires the following items In 1 PDF (it doesn't have to be done, but started): 

1. Blank Page with: 
	1. Name of your expansion
	2. Your names
	3. An intro paragraph (flavor text for the back of a box the size of Frag)
2. An instruction book made in the style of the original.
3. Print and play files for your tokens 
4. 5 questions you need an answer to. 

Week 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Editing Sprint #2
Finish your expansion

And so now, we have the final part of this assignment. This is where you get things mostly in place and get them to a point where you could put it on your portfolio. This shouldn't be fully polished, but everything should be mostly in first draft form. It should include: 

1. Blank Page (if you wanna do cover art, that's cool too): 
	1. A Name
	2. Your names
	3. An intro paragraph (flavor text for the back of a box the size of Frag)
2. An instruction book made in the style of the original.
3. Print and play files for your tokens and pieces where appropriate.
4. Post Mortem - enough words to answer the following: 
		- What went right?
		- What went wrong?
		- If you could start over, what would you change?
		- What would be the most difficult part of this to digitize?
5. Ideas for further development - 250-500 words

Week 7 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Design Sprint #3
Narrative Game: 200 Word RPG

For this assignment, you will be making a tabletop roleplaying game IN GROUPS OF 3. If I just said words you've never heard before, you will be making a game like Dungeons and Dragons. This assignment was suggeted by Marshall Miller via BlueSky as I talked about how to make this course interesting. From that website: https://200wordrpg.github.io/

>Why 200 Words?

>A 200 word limit encourages creativity and demands the very best of your editing and writing abilities. While making a game in 200 words can be difficult, it’s less of a daunting commitment than editing and proofing 285 pages of rules, complete with art and layout.

>Conceiving, designing, and publishing a 200 word game is a great first step toward completing larger game design projects.

For this game, I want the following items in 1 zip file: 
1. Your file made in Microsoft Word and submitted as a .docx file.
	1. Do not put your name in the file.
2. OPTIONAL: A PDF if you want to be fancy and lay the game out. 

Week 8 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Editing Sprint #3
Narrative Game: Playtest 3 200 Word RPGs

The 3 of you are to play 3 of the entries. For your playtests, I want the following items, per player, per game. So, each person should submit their files separately. The space requirement should reflect thoughtful answers to the questions. These will be shared with the designers of said games.

1. Is this a game you would have played without it being an assignment? Why or why not?
2. What was your favorite part of the session you played?
3. In your opinion, what could be improved in the game?    
4. Were there any mechanical aspects of the game that stood out to you (positive or negative)?  

The Editing Rubric applies here.

Week 11 - Final Game . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Sprint #5
This begins our final Project. Due last day of classes.

For this assignment, you will make a physical game of your choice. Many of you who will be going on to 320 might consider making a physical prototype that you can digitize later.
