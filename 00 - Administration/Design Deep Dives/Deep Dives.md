Over the course of the semester, you must explore a variety of games that you probably haven't played before. You will have a choice of 10 games with a mixture being available as Print and Play, Tabletop Simulator, VASL, or some other means. By the end of the semester, I want to see a criticism of 5 of them. The list is as follows: 
    
* [Dungeon Deck](https://github.com/dragonsploder/DungeonDeck)
* [Just One Boss](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=49234)
* [The Dice Must Flow](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173486/dune-the-dice-game)
* [Sprawopolis](https://buttonshygames.com/products/sprawlopolis-print-play}{Sprawopolis)
* [Realm of the Mad God](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200210/Realm_of_the_Mad_God_Exalt/)
* [Airborne in my Pocket](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42651/airborne-in-my-pocket)

* [Rogue (yes, that Rogue)](https://playclassic.games/games/role-playing-dos-games-online/play-rogue-online/play/)

* Core Loop - 20 - 50 words
* Sense of Tension - 100 words
