Over the course of the semester, you will exploring a game that is relatively close to what you can make now (with some exceptions). You will have a choice of 10 games and must play 5. These games are a mixture of Print and Play, Tabletop Simulator available, VASL-based, or can be played by some other means. In service to trends, i've included 2 Roguelikes with one being....Rogue itself.

For this assignment, these will be due just before exams. I will constantly tell you to do them, most of you will ignore me, and then you'll have to do a ton of them at once. I will not allow extensions past the due date for any reason.

The games are:

* [Dungeon Deck](https://github.com/dragonsploder/DungeonDeck)
* [Just One Boss](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=49234)
* [The Dice Must Flow](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173486/dune-the-dice-game)
* [Sprawopolis](https://buttonshygames.com/products/sprawlopolis-print-play}{Sprawopolis)
* [Realm of the Mad God](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200210/Realm_of_the_Mad_God_Exalt/)
* [Airborne in my Pocket](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42651/airborne-in-my-pocket)
* [Basement Bathysphere](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/255360/bargain-basement-bathysphere)

* [Rogue (yes, that Rogue)](https://playclassic.games/games/role-playing-dos-games-online/play-rogue-online/play/)

* Core Loop - 20 - 50 words
* Sense of Tension - 100 words
* What other games it reminds you of and why - 200 words
