**Design Sprints**

You can't become a designer without designing. We'll fail a lot but over time, begin to fail less. Having a successful design is less about your capacity as a designer and more about your capacity as an observer of humanity. In class, we will have 4 design sprints followed by 4 Editing Sprints. 

Generally, these will be either being handed a game or given a prompt to design a game. You will have MW Design Days, Play on Fridays, and Submission by Sunday. On that Sunday, your game needs to have: 

Required Submission:
- Instruction Manual
- Print and Play Files
- Post Mortem - 250 words
- Ideas for further development
