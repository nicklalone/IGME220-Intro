Over the course of the semester, you must explore a variety of games that you probably haven't played before. You will have a choice of 10 games with a mixture being available as Print and Play, Tabletop Simulator, VASL, or some other means. By the end of the semester, I want to see a criticism of 5 of them. The list is as follows: 
    
* [Dungeon Deck](https://github.com/dragonsploder/DungeonDeck)
* [Just One Boss](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=49234)
* [The Dice Must Flow](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173486/dune-the-dice-game)
* [Sprawopolis](https://buttonshygames.com/products/sprawlopolis-print-play}{Sprawopolis)
* [Realm of the Mad God](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200210/Realm_of_the_Mad_God_Exalt/)
* [Airborne in my Pocket](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42651/airborne-in-my-pocket)
* [Basement Bathysphere](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/255360/bargain-basement-bathysphere)
* [Ghosts Love Candy Too](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/349242/ghosts-love-candy-too)
* [Quests Over Coffee](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/367030/quests-over-coffee)
* [Rogue (yes, that Rogue)](https://playclassic.games/games/role-playing-dos-games-online/play-rogue-online/play/)

* Core Loop - 20 - 50 words
* Sense of Tension - 100 words
* What other games it reminds you of and why - 200 words
* How you'd improve it - 200 words

| Comprehension  | I can kind of understand what you have written.                                                                            | Fantastic! You have communicated well.                                                                                             | This meets the needs of literally anyone.                                                                                 |
| Justification  | Your argument is stated as opinion without justification.                                                                  | You partially justify yourself but something is wrong with it.                                                                     | I get it. You made your case. I may not agree but that is irrelevant.                                                     |
| Effort         | Barfed out words at 1150pm on the date dued.                                                                               | It is obvious you didn't start this at 1150p on the day it was due. However, there's some followthrough issues. Check my comments. | Looks good. I get a sense you gave this task some serious consideration. Thank you!                                       |
| Organization   | Things aren't named well, writing hAs Darnodm capiAlzaton AnD smeling erors. Place out Pieces of. NaMes place out file of. | The issue here is that most of your organization is good but there's a last mile issue. Check my comments.                         | Man, let me hire you to give me clarity on the design of everyday things! Come get my life in order.                      |
| Thoughtfulness | So imagine here that you've been asked to show me your design chops as criticisms and you leave me confused.               | You didn't just do go through the motions, but you also didn't quite follow totally through. Please check my comments as to why.   | You looked at the game, and gave me something that reflects your design capacity in a way that makes me want to hire you! |
