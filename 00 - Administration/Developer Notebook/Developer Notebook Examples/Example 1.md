	* **Teaching** - performance is always an interesting game. Take something like Rockstar or Karaoke. In games, this is often some sort of skill check but getting natural language processing in there would be neat. 
	* **Writing** - There are always different prompts to writing. For example, I could write a letter, write a journal article, a blog entry, comments on a student's work or more.

	* **Playing with my cats** - 
	* **Dodging Spam callers** -
