For week 1, there are 3 prompts worth exploring in chapter 1: 
1. Page 10 - Exercise 1.3
	* **Teaching** - performance is always an interesting game. Take something like Rockstar or Karaoke. In games, this is often some sort of skill check but getting natural language processing in there would be neat. 
	* **Writing** - There are always different prompts to writing. For example, I could write a letter, write a journal article, a blog entry, comments on a student's work or more. This was an essential part of Animal Crossing for me earlier in its life and I kind of miss just how much writing you had to do for it. It would be neat to see different kinds of writing for different targets or get into something like Facade to see what fun could come of it. Conversely, interactive fiction allows writing itself to be the thing you consume as a game.
	* **Grading** - For some reason, grading makes me think about Papers, Please. So much depends on the content of the papers and things you send in and yet so much of it depend on the person or object looking at your stuff. I would be curious about somehow making grading into some sort of group-based effort like Herman's Head.
	* **Playing with my cats** - Cats are murderbots that have realized that it's far easier to just be lazy and let us feed them. So we have insane killing machines as pets who don't really need to exercise those skills and yet will occasionally betray us. A game that focuses on something like a Tomagatchi that sometimes will betray us is amazing to me.
	* **Dodging Spam callers** - There's a billion spammers out there and they're nearly all robots. It reminds me of something like Burnout Paradise where it seemed like Humans didn't exist and we were left with a car paradise sans humans. I wonder what would happen in an RPG where a Spam Center wanders the earth looking for purpose, looking for the last surviving humans in a world gone to ruin.
	  
- 5 game design ideas at around a sentence each.
	- 1 out of every 1 million people gain super powers as a comet heads toward earth. 
	- Polydactyl cats develop language and tell us the end is coming.
	- Uncle Chuck owes me 20 bux because he didn't believe I could run a 5 hour marathon. 
	- You play a scientist trying to establish a fact. 
	- You are a homeless man trying to sleep for the night.
	  
- Play decathlon in the syllabus. 
	- It is remarkable just how heated a game of this can get. My wife's family played a ton of Farkle, Yatzee, and other games of chance. I used to watch them get extremely competitive in a game with little to no agency. I found myself competing with my partner well beyond what would be considered normal levels of competition. That this is accomplished with so little is a testament to Knizia's abilities.
