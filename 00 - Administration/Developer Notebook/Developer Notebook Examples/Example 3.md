# Entry 7
The basis of this assignment is relatively simple. We need to write down ideas, concepts, and thoughts related to design all the time. We might see something in the world that inspires us, we might see games that inspire us, we might see a tweet, skeet, or post that keeps us thinking.

That's the purpose of these assignments. 

This should be the second of these an so it should be a bit easier. In your chosen form, submit the following: 
- Around 300 words based on the following prompt:
	- You have been reading Half-Real for a few weeks now. How has it impacted your thoughts on games?
- 5 game design ideas
- Reaction to 1 new game outside your comfort zone
