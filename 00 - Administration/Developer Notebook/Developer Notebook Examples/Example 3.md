	- You have been reading Half-Real for a few weeks now. How has it impacted your thoughts on games?

I mean, this book makes sense but from a design perspective, there's a lot of interesting things that come out of it. For example, I have long wondered why even in VR where I can make whatever I want that when i'm working on a display of some kind in some sort of VR game, it's a rectangle. When I see video games have televisions or monitors, it's a rectangle. 

From a design perspective, we need to have these references because we, as players, as users, are going to know that they are display devices. Even when they change, for example in Harry Potter on newspapers or paintings, or in Children of Men on thin paper-like strips, they're still rectangular, still the thing that we would anticipate. 

It makes me think about something like Star Trek, the original series, where we saw them using discs because the idea that a computer would have ample internal memory was just not possible to consider, even in a far off future. It is something akin to Robinson Crusoe in space where folks really thought that this was how someone would live in Mars only for it to look very silly when we went to the moon. 

Reality and technology are constantly changing and we need that frame of reference to ground us, even when we're considering the future, even when we're designing a video game. The need for something to be half-real in order for users to make it into your UI and play your game is something i'll carry with me for a while.

- 5 game design ideas
1. When I lived in Nebraska, my neighbor was a drug dealer. The whole neighborhood brought him down and he's still in jail. the game idea from this is that you have a neighbor who is hiding things, doing things that they shouldn't. Your job isn't to catch them or capture them or fight them, but just to photograph them in some way that let's you prove that they're doing bad things. It is a game that takes place in local time and there's no way of knowing who or how or why your neighbor is doing things. 
   
2. I have a new kitten who is just now being let out of the room we put her in to slowly introduce her to the household. Watching her wander around trying to make sense of what she's seeing really gives me a game idea. You begin in a dark room and slowly start to see shadows, then shapes, colors. Sort of like EVO: the search for eden but far more personal.
   
3. I like games that reflect the nature of water. It is an invasive substance that can find cracks in just about anything. I've been thinking about *Flower* and wonder about a game called *Flows* where you're water and trying to do 2 things: 1. Expand, 2. Restrict expansion enough not to run too thin that the elements will dry you out (thus, the game ends).
   
4. A game about playing an attribute of a character while said character is engaged in adventuring. 

5. A game called, "The Collector" but you're in a world like Katamari and can collect...anything. 

- Reaction to 1 new game outside your comfort zone

For this game, I chose Trombone Champ. I like games like this but they make me intensely uncomfortable. When i was a kid, the NES came out and some friends had a power pad. Running on that thing, I felt enormous shame. It wasn't because I was unable to be athletic, I played every sport possible. Instead, it was because in the intimacy of a kid's bedroom or family room, I was supposed to run in the real world and watch my virtual self move. It felt alien and made me uncomfortable. 

This feeling of discomfort has not allowed me to really get into the rhythm games, VR (though this is compounded with motion sickness), and a lot of Wii games. There's something extremely unlikeable about these games to me. So it is perfect fodder for this assignment. 

In Trombone Champ, you are a person playing a Trombone. You move the controllers around to mimic playing a trombone and then engage in a game like Guitar Hero as you try and slide through various songs as a boner. This game, unlike the others I have already mentioned, isn't meant to be serious, but help people make fun of this discomfort in an hilarious way. 

Sliding around the notes while trying to make a song sound like the song really adds to the atmosphere. You're doing an uncomfortable thing that sounds and looks as uncomfortable as trying to do the thing in real life. It takes enormous effort to get a trombone to work properly, to sound good. Don't even begin to think you'll get that here.

But yet, there is a seriousness about it that is possible to pursue. I've seen some performances from folks playing this game that are as impressive as that of the trombone. And here, I think, is one of my favorite parts of game design. You can have ridiculousness and seriousness in the same space.
