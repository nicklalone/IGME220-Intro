The basis of this assignment is relatively simple. We need to write down ideas, concepts, and thoughts related to design all the time. We might see something in the world that inspires us, we might see games that inspire us, we might see a tweet, skeet, or post that keeps us thinking.

That's the purpose of these assignments. 

This should be the second of these an so it should be a bit easier. In your chosen form, submit the following: 
- Around 300 or more words based on a selected prompt.
	1. Page 157 - Exercise 5.7
	2. On page 161 is Dan Cook's Interaction Loops and Arcs. Incorporate this into a game you played recently. Map the loops and arcs out.
	3. Tell me how you might add Bartering to a First Person Shooter in the midst of play without stopping or pausing the flow of the game.
- 5 game design ideas

### **Prompt:** 
	Tell me how you might add Bartering to a First Person Shooter in the midst of play without stopping or pausing the flow of the game.

So I have been thinking about the shops in Spelunkey. You go in mid-game and buy new equipment with some resources. The game doesn't pause, doesn't change and you can create a hell of a problem for yourself if you steal from the shop as the shopkeep will begin attacking and is a force to be reckoned with. In light of that, i've been pretty interested in thinking about it from that point of view. 

So I might put a shop in that you can shop at with money generated from kills or maybe some sort of bounty system. With that money, you can go to the middle of the map to shoot and/or grab with a button press. Inside the area, nothing will be deactivated, nothing will be off the table. If you shoot the shop keep or shoot anything besides an item, auto-mounted guns will come out of the ceiling and begin to fire. Once activated, they will not deactivate and so we can add to a trolling strategy type player that will add a degree of chaos that a variety of games lack. 
### **5 game design ideas**
* Today, I watched a barista from Starbucks sneak his friends food by telling folks that their label didn't print and so they'd have to remake it. A game idea from this is scam creation and some form of Don't Wake Daddy but Don't Wake Shrinkage Police. Digitally, it'd be something like a stealth game or something. Physically, it could be a lot like Space Alert but with cops rather than robots.
* I have an old man cat on the brink of crossing the rainbow bridge. One thought about making a game somewhat like **Holding On: The Troubled Life of Billy Kerr** but it focuses on the memories a cat brings with them as they go on to the next life. I'm in tears thinking about this game and my cat though so this game would be a bear to create.
* When I ran today, there was a group of folks on the canal writing phrases on the sidewalk and trying to get folks to feel love, feel welcome, feel accepted, and feel wanted. In the current climate, this can be hard and so i'm interested in a game that juxtaposes how someone feels about themselves and how others can make them feel those things. Using the black cards with white text approach, I can act out a scene and folks can try and cheer me up. Simple game, but it takes the casual racism of CAH and makes it into a game about caring. 
* I get hungry when i'm anxious and when i'm anxious and when i'm hungry, I have grumps and feelings I have no idea what to do with. In this game, you have hunger grumps and it is 1 v All. Everyone dictates what you do as you try and get to food. I'm thinking it would be something like Doug Doug's trying to take a bath in Red Dead Redemption 2 but allowing chat to control what spawns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPybJCLeDpk&ab_channel=DougDoug
* I have a new kitten and i'd like to keep him separated so her smell slowly joins wiht the rest of the smells in the house. In this game, you control a slowly expanding smell molecule and your job is to mix with the others sort of like flower but as a board game.
### **Reaction to 1 new game outside your comfort zone**
For this game, I chose FC 26 from EA. While I played soccer in high school and keep up with soccer here and there, it's been a long time and I haven't really played a FIFA game or Soccer oriented game since I played EA Sports' Quidditch Manager.

One of the things about sports games from EA is that they've all come from the same place, strat-o-matic sports. I love the wargame nature of these games. Each time I play Madden or The Show or something, I am reminded that these games are essentially made of the same stuff that RPGs are. That jocks and nerds are connected in the thing they get nerdy about is something that I wish game designers would consider more. It is rare, for example, to see a good overlap of rpgs and sports outside of something like Blood Bowl.

Now, Blood Bowl has survived though, not because of the game itself, but because ofo the fandom. Games Workshop ressurecting the game to make money off of it represents the worst of what games are all about. 

Back to FC26, this is your standard fare sim. I like games like this but I have to be in the right mindset for it. It's the same with chit-based wargames and LARP, I have to be invested and motivated, probably in some sort of league.
