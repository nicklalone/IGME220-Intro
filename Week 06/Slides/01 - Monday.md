notes: I want to start with this man. Napoleon Bonaparte. Actually, slightly before him.

notes: the cassini family, just before Napoleon, completed the composite of France. https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~25839~1090005:Composite-15--Carte-de-France- This thing was considered a wonder of the world and is perhaps the single most important technological jump in recent history. From this document, we would see modern cartography, the finishing of the thousands of years it took to understand longitutude, and the creation of modern analytics leading to the computer.

notes: And so we get back to this guy. He saw this and thought...omg, I could conquer everything.

notes: This battle is perhaps the most important battle of Napoleon's campaigns. He defeated the Prussians so soundly that he literally changed the world. And from there, things get interesting.

# something new to do with video games.
--
# and so here we are.
---
# many consider ttrpgs niche
--
# but this is an experimentation ground
--
# the mystique of logic and rules
--
# and how they mediate play
--
## what hasn't been digitized yet?
## we keep experimenting.
--
# and so our game we're making:
--
# what is a ttrpg?
--
# imagination + rules + motivation
--
# Requirements: 
--
# 1. conflict resolution
--
# 2. what is important to the world
--
# 3. limitations
--
# lots of you started with dnd
## 1200+ pages of rules...
---
## We boil the experience down to a single page.
--
## really, it's 200 words
--
## this will be the hardest thing you design.

## 4. Enough info to stimulate play
