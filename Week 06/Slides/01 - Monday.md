# tabletop RPGs - let's get some context
notes: Buckle in! How many of you have played D&D? What about other games? On average, how many hours would you say you've devoted to this mode of play?

![[napoleon.png]]
notes: I want to start with this man. Napoleon Bonaparte. Actually, slightly before him.
--
![[composite of france.png]]
notes: the cassini family, just before Napoleon, completed the composite of France. https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~25839~1090005:Composite-15--Carte-de-France- This thing was considered a wonder of the world and is perhaps the single most important technological jump in recent history. From this document, we would see modern cartography, the finishing of the thousands of years it took to understand longitutude, and the creation of modern analytics leading to the computer.

![[napoleon.png]]
notes: And so we get back to this guy. He saw this and thought...omg, I could conquer everything.
--
![[jenaaur.png]]
notes: This battle is perhaps the most important battle of Napoleon's campaigns. He defeated the Prussians so soundly that he literally changed the world. And from there, things get interesting.
--
![[kriegspiel.png]]
notes: Kriegspiel was the answer to dealing with Napoleon's analytics and probability of success-based metrics. Through this game, they could feed commands to an objective 3rd party who would then carry out those commands for the players involved. It allowed for the logic of war to be pursued relentlessly and slowly became the most popular and important game in the world.
--
![[playing krieg.png]]
notes: much like how we treat chess or go now, it was the game you learned if you wanted to be a logician of war, develop your strategic mind, and look for strategies.
--
![[input output.png]]
notes: What else has this structure? There's no direction because it is a continuous loop. We can also just keep adding players exponentially.
--
# what else resembles this?
notes: D&D, distributed computing, video games.

![[twincitiescrew.png]]
notes: the twin cities crew. Minneapolis-St. Paul. Starting in the early 1960s, there was a lively group of players here, several hundred. They had their own zines, newsletters, and massive meetups. Around the mid 1960s, a young college student at UMinnestoa named David Wesley found a game called Strategos which had all these rules for running a wargame including 1 that said, "the umpire controls the world." And so he put together these captain-only games that had few rules called Braunstein. This was the earliest we can say ttrpgs existed. Gygax wouldn't be introduced until the early 1970s and he would commercialize the game. 
--
![[strategosn.png]]
notes: Early on, the twin cities crew was messing around with automation in much the same way as everyone was during ww1 and ww2 looking at ways to get automation into wargaming. 
--
![[firstcomputers.png]]
notes: in the background of history, this was starting to take off. In 1974, there was a convergence of D&D + Computing. 
--
# another important thing
---
![[dungeon crawl.png]]
notes: that important thing was the Dungeon Crawl. It wasn't initially a thing anyone did until Dave Arneson took over Wesley's games and the players kept focusing on dungeons rather than interpersonal stuff. While many point to LOTR, it was more Conan that informed much of D&D for Arneson, LOTR for Gygax.

# Computer-mediated DND
![[pedit5dnd.png]]
notes: Immediately upon release of dnd, the first folks to buy D&D at Gencon 3 came back home and folks in Illinois who had access to PLATO had an idea, "Dungeon Crawls as videogames."
---
# so from this one angry dude...
--
![[space war.png]]
notes: we get war machines that are then used to create digital representations of parlor games and physics simulations.
--
![[tennis42.png]]
notes: but these had a shelf life. We didn't really have a good idea of what to do with this. 
--
# combined with dnd and...
notes: but then we see this product appear that combined games of war with imaginative play. And through that, the whole of how we thought about video games changed.
--
![[oubliette.png]]
notes: this game, Oubliette, many of you would never have heard of. But combine an angry admin at a college, a book publisher, and some enterprising teens who could quickly rewrite this into a new language and we might have heard of it.
--
![[wizardry.png]]
notes: Wizardry changed everything. This is the game that introduced crpgs to Japan which then began this massive cycle of design we call the game industry.
--
# and so here we are.
---
# many consider ttrpgs niche
notes: While we see a ton of money tossed around, it's to a very few folks. D&D is seen as TTRPGS but it's an incredibly vast ecosystem of games and experiments.
--
# but this is an experimentation ground
notes: from games about a set of clothes to games about incredibly dark topics, ttrpgs cover every aspect of humanity. They are an experimentation ground.
--
# the mystique of logic and rules
notes: computation is the use of logic and rules in a way that stokes the mystery of life. TTRPGs are those things made bare, malleable, and explorable.
--
# and how they mediate play
notes: and this is where things are interesting. While I might make a game that has stark rules, they are rarely played in the way they are written. This has an impact on video gaming but ttrpgs are where we can experiment with that relationship.
--
## Juxtaposed against video games 
notes: We can take video game history and compare it to ttrpgs.
--
## map size & graphics but not logic
notes: games haven't fundamentally changed outside of polygons and map size since around the 80s. It's only recently we started to see games like Dwarf Fortress start to challenge this. Maybe we'll see a supplemental logic card smashed into our future PC keyboards in addition to a supplemental graphics processor. 
--
## video games have staled
notes: until then, video games have staled. We don't know what to do with them anymore. Your job as a designer in this staleness is to find something interesting to do with them and it is in this space that created video games as they are now that you can do so. 
--
# ttrpgs ask us: 
--
## what hasn't been digitized yet?
notes: we need to keep experimenting.
--
# and so our game we're making:
--
# what is a ttrpg?
--
# imagination + rules + motivation
--
# Requirements: 
--
# 1. conflict resolution
--
# 2. why your character exists
--
# 3. limitations
--
# lots of you started with dnd
## 1200+ pages of rules...
---
## We boil the experience down to a single page.
--
## really, it's 200 words
--
## this will be the hardest thing you design.

# Process of Design

## 1. Theme
--
## 2. Core Component of that theme
--
## 3. Mechanical translation

## 4. Enough info to stimulate play
