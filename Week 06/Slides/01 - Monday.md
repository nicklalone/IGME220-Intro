notes: I want to start with this man. Napoleon Bonaparte. Actually, slightly before him.

![[composite of france.png]]
notes: the cassini family, just before Napoleon, completed the composite of France. https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~25839~1090005:Composite-15--Carte-de-France- This thing was considered a wonder of the world and is perhaps the single most important technological jump in recent history. From this document, we would see modern cartography, the finishing of the thousands of years it took to understand longitutude, and the creation of modern analytics leading to the computer.

notes: And so we get back to this guy. He saw this and thought...omg, I could conquer everything.

notes: This battle is perhaps the most important battle of Napoleon's campaigns. He defeated the Prussians so soundly that he literally changed the world. And from there, things get interesting.

![[kriegspiel.png]]
notes: Kriegspiel was the answer to dealing with Napoleon's analytics and probability of success-based metrics. Through this game, they could feed commands to an objective 3rd party who would then carry out those commands for the players involved. It allowed for the logic of war to be pursued relentlessly and slowly became the most popular and important game in the world.

notes: much like how we treat chess or go now, it was the game you learned if you wanted to be a logician of war, develop your strategic mind, and look for strategies.

![[input output.png]]
notes: What else has this structure? There's no direction because it is a continuous loop. We can also just keep adding players exponentially.
--
# what else resembles this?
notes: D&D, distributed computing, video games.

notes: the twin cities crew. Minneapolis-St. Paul

notes: Early on, the twin cities crew was messing around with automation in much the same way as everyone was during ww1 and ww2.

# something new to do with video games.
--
# and so here we are.
---
# many consider ttrpgs niche
--
# but this is an experimentation ground
--
# the mystique of logic and rules
--
# and how they mediate play
--
## what hasn't been digitized yet?
## we keep experimenting.
--
# and so our game we're making:
--
# what is a ttrpg?
--
# imagination + rules + motivation
--
# Requirements: 
--
# 1. conflict resolution
--
# 2. what is important to the world
--
# 3. limitations
--
# lots of you started with dnd
## 1200+ pages of rules...
---
## We boil the experience down to a single page.
--
## really, it's 200 words
--
## this will be the hardest thing you design.

# Process of Design
--
## 1. Theme
--
## 2. Core Component of that theme
--
## 3. Mechanical translation
--
## 4. Enough info to stimulate play
