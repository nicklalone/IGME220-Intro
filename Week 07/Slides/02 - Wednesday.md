# Chapter 1 - Intro
notes: This chapter asks us: What makes video games distinct, and how do rules and fiction interact in video games? This is important to design. Consider my feedback in y our journals. I have been pushing this narrative this semester in terms of gamer = consumer =/= designer. In this case, I am also making the case that I do not want you to make facsimiles of what you've consumed, but design something others might see as new.

## players both follow rules  and imagine fictional worlds 
notes: He distinguishes between games and play. But also, this is more than narrative. Your rules convey the nature of your worlds.

notes: This quote is actually from chapter 2 but this is an important distinction. We can separate play from game but english as a language is not really capable of that. Instead, we have to hint at it.

# Chapter 2 - Classic Game Model
notes: Presents a “classic game model” which captures characteristics of video games: these are partially generic but are mostly applicable to video games first.
--
## rules, objectives, 
## outcome; effort; 
## variability; emotional attachment; 
## optional/negotiable consequences. 
--
## how has computer-mediated play extended or changed possibilities? 
notes: notes: if games originate through make believe and war along with the computer, how has the computer changed the way we play? Professional game industry, an entertainment industry made for farming engagement and wonder. An experimentation space for televisions, supplemental processors, and more. This means video games are more than just an industry for play.

# Chapter 3
notes: A deep dive into the role of rules in games: what they are, how they work, how they generate challenge. Rules are about what actions are allowed/not allowed, how the system responds, how outcomes are evaluated. 
--
##  “rule‑based systems” have structure independent of whether the game is digital or not
notes: many elements of gameplay (challenge, learning, skill development) come through rules. 
--    
## rules constrain fictional worlds
--
rules can be visible or hidden to the player. Some rules are explicit, some implicit. 
--
## players understand rules through use
notes: play and use are often not that dissimilar. 
--
## designers communicate through making rules plain or obscure
notes: how this manifests in your design is often subconscious but will make itself known.

notes: This is what you're making with your ttrpg. It is a valuable portfolio piece so I urge you all to take it seriously.

## "I negotiated with 2 people to establish a social contract for our own fictional world."
notes: here, the social contract is much like our own. In following the norms and values and laws and structures of the world you live in, we have a society. The police, justice system, and more allow us to know that if folks stop believing in this system, that we will be able to rest easy as society will take care of it.
